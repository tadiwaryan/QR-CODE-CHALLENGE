# QR CODE CHALLENGE

This challenge was very fun for me, it took me a while but i learnt a lot about the importance of using the appropriate CSS units, organising a project, thinking about layout and most importantly how to use the internet for research. StackOverflow if used wisely is an amazing resource and discord is great too!

Am yet to improve my flexbox skills and to start using semantic HTML5 markup, in my next project am definitely going to use these technologies more.

Special thanks to my friend Jab for helping me with this one.
